# EXAMPLES

The examples folder contains examples of custom environment files.

To use these files:
1. Copy to the _start.settings folder
2. update the values in the file to match your individual settings for the environment

Use these custom settings files to store sensitive information and keys for your environment.

Do not include the custom files in _start.settings in the git repository.

See the README.md file in _start.settings to activate a custom settings file.
