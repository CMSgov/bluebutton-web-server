    To try out the API using Swagger UI, follow these steps:

    1. **Create an Application**: Ensure you have an application set up on [CMS Sandbox](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov).
    2. **Update Application Settings**: Go to your application settings and add [https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/docs/oauth2-redirect](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/docs/oauth2-redirect) to the "Callback URLs / Redirect URIs" field under "App Details - Required Information". Save the updated application settings.
    3. **Store Client Credentials**: Note down and securely store your client_id and client_secret from your CMS Sandbox application. These credentials will be used later.
    4. **Authorize in Swagger UI**: Open this Swagger UI and click on the "Authorize" button.
    5. **Authorize Access**: Within the prompt, input your client_id and client_secret, choose the scopes you want to use in your testing, and click "Authorize" to open a new tab where you will grant consent to your application from a sample beneficiary. In order to log in, you can use a sample beneficiary using the login instructions from [this link](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/testclient/authorize-link-v2).
    6. **Complete Consent**: Follow the prompts to complete the consent form.
    7. **Return to Swagger UI**: After consenting, you will be redirected back to this Swagger UI.
    8. **Explore APIs**: You can now start exploring and testing the APIs by providing the relevant parameters.

                      Fetch _Patient_ data using a FHIR _IdType_ identifier; an IdType
  
                      represents the logical identity for a resource, or as much of that
  
                      identity that is known. In FHIR, every resource must have a
                      _logical ID_ which is
  
                      defined by the [FHIR
                      specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/datatypes.html#id) as:
  
  
                      `Any combination of upper or lower case ASCII letters ('A'..'Z',
                      and 'a'..'z', numerals ('0'..'9'),
  
                      '-' and '.', with a length limit of 64 characters. (This might be
                      an integer, an un-prefixed OID, UUID
  
                      or any other identifier pattern that meets these constraints.)`
  
  
                      This class contains that logical ID, and can optionally also
                      contain a relative or absolute URL
  
                      representing the resource identity; the following are all valid
                      values for IdType, and all might
  
                      represent the same resource:

                      Fetch _Patient_ data using a FHIR _identifier_; an identifier
                      contains a set of values that
        
                      include the logical identity for a resource. In FHIR, the
                      _identifier_ is a parent element
        
                      defined by the [FHIR
                      specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/datatypes-definitions.html#Identifier)
                      as:
        
        
                      `A string, typically numeric or alphanumeric, that is associated
                      with a single object or entity within a given system.
        
                      Typically, identifiers are used to connect content in resources to
                      external content available in other frameworks or protocols.
        
                      Identifiers are associated with objects and may be changed or
                      retired due to human or system process and errors.`
        
        
                      This class contains the identifier, which is usually represented
                      as a URL, along with a single, url encoded, pipe-delimited
                      key|value pair, with the value as
        
                      (mbi, hicn, etc); the following are all valid values for
                      Identifier, and all might represent the same resource:
                        - `identifier=https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/identifier/hicn-hash|<your hicn hash>`
                        - `identifier=https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/identifier/mbi-hash|<your mbi hash>`
