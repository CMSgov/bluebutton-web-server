# Inferno SMART App Launch Test Kit

This is a collection of tests for the [SMART Application Launch Framework
Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) using the
[Inferno Framework](https://inferno-framework.github.io/inferno-core/), verifying
that a server can provide authorization and/or authentication services to client 
applications accessing HL7速 FHIR速 APIs.

## Instructions

- Clone this repo.
- Run `setup.sh` in this repo.
- Run `run.sh` in this repo.
- Navigate to `http://localhost`. The SMART test suite will be available.

## Versions
This test kit contains both the SMART App Launch STU1 and SMART App Launch STU2
suites. While these suites are generally designed to test implementations of
the SMART App Launch Framework, each suite is tailored to the
[STU1](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/) and
[STU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/) versions of SMART, respectively.

## Importing tests

Tests from this test kit can be imported to perform the SMART App Launch
workflow as part of another test suite. The tests are arranged in groups which
can be easily reused.

In order for the redirect and launch urls to be determined correctly, make sure
that the `INFERNO_HOST` environment variable is populated in `.env` with the
scheme and host where inferno will be hosted.

### AuthInfo

The tests in this test kit rely heavily on the
[`AuthInfo`](https://inferno-framework.github.io/inferno-core/docs/Inferno/DSL/AuthInfo.html)
input type. This is a complex input type which contains the information needed to:
- Perform a SMART App Launch workflow
- Access resources using credentials obtained from a SMART App Launch workflow
- Refresh credentials obtained from a SMART App Launch workflow

When a FHIR Client is configured to use `AuthInfo`, it will automatically
attempt to perform a token refresh when prior to the current access token's
expiration.

### Example

```ruby
require 'smart_app_launch_test_kit'

class MySuite < Inferno::TestSuite
  id :my_suite
  title 'My Suite'
  input :url

  group do
    title 'Auth'

    config(
      inputs: {
        smart_auth_info: { name: :standalone_smart_auth_info }
      },
      outputs: {
        smart_auth_info: { name: :standalone_smart_auth_info }
      }
    )

    group from: :smart_discovery
    group from: :smart_standalone_launch
  end

  group do
    title 'Make some HL7速 FHIR速 requests using SMART credentials'

    input :standalone_smart_auth_info,
          type: :auth_info,
          options: { mode: 'access' }

    fhir_client do
      url :url
      auth_info :standalone_smart_auth_info # Obtained from the auth group
    end

    test do
      title 'Retrieve patient from SMART launch context'

      input :standalone_patient_id

      run do
        fhir_read(:patient, standalone_patient_id)

        assert_response_status(200)
        assert_resource_type(:patient)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
